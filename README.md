# CV_HandTracking

## Description

This practice project is a real-time computer vision application that uses a webcam and MediaPipeâ€™s hand tracking to detect pinch gestures for drawing. By pinching your thumb and index finger together, you can draw on a virtual canvas. Bringing four fingers close together acts as an eraser. This project demonstrates gesture-based interaction without the need for physical input devices.
